I took the idea of smooth scroll in pure javascript from Stack Overflow and I made some modifications. So if you don't wanna change your html document and you wanna use it for many scroll targets, but you are an absolute beginner and you don't know how to solve it, this may help you. Small modifications but solution is very simple and reusable. I also wrote code to sort my projects by language or framework. I guess it's not the best solution, but i did it on my own and it's simple, reusable and works pretty good.
